# AutoBeale
AutoBeale: code to calculate loads by means of Beale's Ratio Estimator.


The following information is from Peter Richards, the original author of this version of the AutoBeale estimator software:

> "The Beale Ratio Estimator is described in Tin (1965).  It has been widely used for computation of substance loadings to receiving waters, particularly in the Great Lakes system.  The initial code was developed by Ken Baun of Wisconsin DNR (1982).  It was subsequently used and developed by Kevin McGunagle at the International Joint Commission (IJC), from whom the current version was received. It was then developed in the 1990’s by Pete Richards at the National Center for Water Quality Research at Heidleberg University (www.heidelberg.edu/academiclife/distinctive/ncwqr).  Peter developed the code to work with the Macintosh computer of the time (“Motorola" architecture, which was replaced by Intel architecture ca. 2005), and included a Graphic User Interface (GUI) and an algorithm that objectively and sequentially searched out the best stratification given the data, with “best” being defined as minimizing the root-mean-square error (RMSE) given the data at hand. This is the current and final version.  A Windows version of the code was also developed, with a minimal GUI."  


**The code included in this archive contains the minimal Windows GUI.**
